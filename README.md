# FullMusicTheory
An app to teach music theory, ear training, etc. Not only western music theory, but any music theory around the world (historical and otherwise). On any instrument.
The lessons will be formatted in a simple-to-understand, and *fun* manner, developed by an AI algorithm. 
The AI itself will use the latest research in pedagogy to formulate lessons that teach in a way that's best for you to actually retain the information and maximize the efficiency of your time spent learning.

The app and its development uses the latest research & models from the field of AI, to integrate and automatically (but very intelligently & intentionally) add music theory lessons from:
1. Western Music Theory.
2. Music theory from elsewhere around the world: For example, the Indian Music Theory, which is much more expanded with its use of extra tonalities. Another example would be, music theory specific to a country, like Japanese music theory.
3. Historically-accurate ancient music theory: For example, historically-accurate ancient Greek music theory which is not normally taught outside of a few academic courses in certain colleges. Another example would be, ancient middle eastern music theory, like that of the ancient Hebrews/Israelites, ancient Sumerians, ancient Akkadians, ancient Indians, ancient 
4. Learn to play on any world musical instrument (modern or ancient). Thanks to powerful AI, it will be able to teach you any instrument from around the world, or from history. There will be limitations, as well known & modern instruments, will have more advanced & more accurate information on learning them, but the AI can get you started on rare instruments which most teachers would be puzzled about (like some rare African instrument).

The features I'm planning to add to increase the teaching ability of the AI music teacher, is integration with:
1. The latest AI audio recognition (for voice training; and for general tone recognition, for recognizing notes, chords, etc on any instrument), based on the latest research from the field of AI audio processing.
2. Video recognition: To let the AI see what you're actually doing, to interact with the AI visually. For example, the AI will be able to see how you're playing the instrument (e.g., the position of your fingers on the fretboard), or even your posture, and so on. Moreover, you'll even be able to learn with the AI teacher, by holding up a piece of paper with your own drawings, charts, or sheetmusic.
